When I woke up, I had been reborn as a baby. My mother passed away and I was neglected by my father. Even though I was born in a Marquis family, my life started on HARD MODE. But I wonâ€™t be discouraged. I will eat well, sleep well, move a lot, get whatever I can get and live happily.

But for some reason, a lot of incidents happen. This is a story of a little girl with the power to create barriers in a world where the Hollows and Humans are in conflict. She gets other people involved in those incidents and becomes happy.
